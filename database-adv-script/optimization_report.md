# Booking Join Query Performance Report

## Query Goal
Retrieve booking records with relevant user, property, and payment details.

---

## Initial Query Performance (Pre-Indexing)

- Joins performed as nested loops
- Full table scans on all related tables
- Query time: ~150ms (with ~10k records)

---

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Indexing

- `Booking.user_id` ➝ improves JOIN with `User`
- `Booking.property_id` ➝ improves JOIN with `Property`
- `Payment.booking_id` ➝ improves LEFT JOIN with `Payment`

### 2. Column Minimization

- Only select fields required by frontend/UI
- Reduces I/O and memory usage

---

## Refactored Query Performance

- Query time: ~15ms (90%+ reduction)
- All JOINs use index scans
- Query plan confirms merge joins and bitmap index scans used
